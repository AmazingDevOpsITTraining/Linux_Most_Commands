# Linux_Most_Commands

Hey Class, attached, find all the commands you need to know in Linux. 

Pay close attention to the GREP AWK and SED commands. 

They are vital in operating Linux servers and systems. 

Linux operating system has different flavors. They include

Centos.

Debian.

Elementary OS.

Fedora Linux.

Gentoo Linux.

Before starting running the Linux command, I will help you create Amazon Linux Server in the cloud. 

We will access that server remotely and start to run the Linux commands. 

Fork this repository so that you can have it.
